# Surfs Up Challenge

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze the weather data that is stored in a SQLLite database. The information that we gather will be crucial to determine whether or not it is in an investors favor to open up a Surf n' Shake location in Oahu, Hawaii. More after creating an initial full year weather analysis I now focus on the months of June and December to assert if the business can be sustainable year-round.

## Results

Upon further exploration of the data, there are a few visible differences between temperatures between both months;

* There are far more records of precipitation in the month of June as oposed to December.
* The mean temperature for June is 74.94℉, nearly 4° degrees higher than that of December.
* The biggest difference is in minimum recorder temperature, with June logging in at 64℉ degrees and December at 56℉.

## Summary

Despite these differences in temperature, if you take a closer look at the top 75 percentiles whe can see that the days in which december records such low temps must be a few. All in all the data seems to be pretty close during a "summer" month and a "winter" one. The differences do not seem to be significant enough to reasonably deter our investor from continuing his venture project and opening up another Surf n' Shake location.

Perhaps if we wanted to dive deeper into this we can create a full month line chart for each day to highlight some of the differences found or even a box & whisker plot to do the same!
