# Surfs Up Challenge

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze the weather data that is stored in a SQLLite database. The information that we gather will be crucial to determine whether or not it is in an investors favor to open up a Surf n' Shake location in Oahu, Hawaii. More after creating an initial full year weather analysis I now focus on the months of June and December to assert if the business can be sustainable year-round.

## Results

Upon further exploration of the data, there are a few visible differences between temperatures between both months;

* There are far more records of precipitation in the month of June as oposed to December.
* The mean temperature for June is 74.94℉, nearly 4° degrees higher than that of December.
* The biggest difference is in minimum recorder temperature, with June logging in at 64℉ degrees and December at 56℉.

## Summary

Despite these differences in temperature, if you take a closer look at the top 75 percentiles whe can see that the days in which december records such low temps must be a few. All in all the data seems to be pretty close during a "summer" month and a "winter" one. The differences do not seem to be significant enough to reasonably deter our investor from continuing his venture project and opening up another Surf n' Shake location.
